- Check that all the marine and freshwater genome are in the new refseq database.
- If some are missing add them to refseq.
- BLAST all freshwater genes taking top 50 hits.

* Analysis 1
What is the top hit non fresh-water. Is it from marine or from something else in refseq. Make standard graph.

* Analysis 2
Considering the list of top hits that are all from fresh-water. Stopping as soon as a top hit is not freshwater. Is there another hit within the same genome other than, obviously, the query itself. Get the list of the gene IDs.

---------------------------------------
- With the trees when considering how many conserve the split 3a-3b, only consider those that have bootstrap over 80%.

- Make a table where we check using all trees if the successive splits of the reference tree are conserved
