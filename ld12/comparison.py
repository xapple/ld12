class Comparison(object):
    """Takes care of comparing the trees created by the various clusters with
    the master ribosomal protein trees.

    For every tree (from clusters) compare with the ribosomal tree: How well does the structure correspond. How often do we find the same split between the families.When we don't fin the same split, which families are miss-spiting.

    1) Check that on the cluster trees the families are grouping together, either kick the ones that don't out, or report how many times a certain split is not conserved (uncollapsible)

    2) The trees that collapse nicely compare it with master tree setting the root at V and checking that the same branching patterns exists.

    3) If there is a popular alternative branching pattern, draw it in the supplementary and add as numbers how many clusters had this exact alternative branching."""
