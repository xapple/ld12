- Check all the marine and freshwater genome are in the new refseq database.
- If some are missing add them to refseq
- BLAST all freshwater genes taking top 20 hits.

* Analysis 1
What is the top hit non fresh-water. Is it from marine or from something else in refseq. Make graph

* Analysis 2
COnsidering the list of top hits that are all from fresh-water. Stopping as soon as a top hit is not freshwater. Is there another hit within the same genome other than, obviously, the query itself. Get the list of the gene IDs.
